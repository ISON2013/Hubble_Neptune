OPAL Neptune Cycle 22 Maps READ ME file

Neptune data were acquired with WFC3/UVIS between Sept. 18, 2015 07:15 UT and Sept. 19, 2015 06:19 UT (two subsequent orbits were lost due to guide star acquisition failures).

NOTE: These maps are centered on 0 deg W longitude, to center the interesting cloud complex near 45 deg. S. latitude.

Images were navigated using an ellipsoid limb fitting technique with equatorial and polar radii of 24764 and 24341 km, respectively.  The FQ727N data were fringe corrected post-pipeline, resulting in an ~1.0% correction. Each map was generated at the sub-earth longitude +/-90 at 2 pixels/deg resolution, between -90 and +90 deg planetographic latitude; this oversamples the data.  Maps were mosaicked to cover 360 deg of longitude (left edge = 180 deg W. longitude, decreasing to the right) and seams between maps were interpolated to smooth, where needed.  The table below lists the Minnaert correction (ratio of cosines of incidence and emission angles to the k power) applied to remove limb darkening for each map.  The mosaics are available in TIF (arbitrarily scaled) and FITS.  The FITS values can be converted to I/F by multiplying by the values in the table below.  Two global maps exist for each filter, covering two full rotations of Neptune, though longitudes were missed in the second rotation. Color maps (TIFF only), are generated from the F657N (red), F547M (green), and F467M (blue) filters, with some contrast enhancement.
